        SolidWorks is the most widely used professional 3D CAD software worldwide. 
        It is also notorious for being the antithesis of direct modeling. Nothing can be dragged, sculpted, or directly manipulated in any other way. 
        With constraint-based modeling, all features are saved in a history tree along with their parameters. 
        Right from the first sketch, the designer needs to input numbers to lock the sketch into its intended position, as well as its relationships to other elements of the design. 
        The same goes for assemblies. Parts are tightly interconnected to other parts, and subassemblies to other assemblies.
         Where part constraints define product geometry and manufacturing intent, mating constraints determine how parts can move in an assembly. SOLIDWORKS is used by millions of designers and engineers at hundreds of thousands of companies. It’s one of the most popular design and engineering software on the market.<br> Known for its range of features and high functionality, SOLIDWORKS is used across multiple professions and industries around the world.

         SOLIDWORKS uses parametric design, which is why it’s such an effective tool for designers and engineers. This means that the designer can see how changes will affect its neighboring components, or even the overall solution. For example, if the size of a single component is increased, this would affect the joint or hole it’s attached to. This allows designers to spot and correct issues quickly and easily.
    
    The main advantage of this style of modeling is that in case of updates and revisions, the model will dynamically update as the design requirements change.
     Once this is mastered, it will become increasingly intuitive. This powerful way of modeling requires careful planning and a rigorously procedural working method as opposed to more exploratory approaches. 
    One of the software’s downsides is that errors will happen in the feature tree when parts are not properly constrained or surfaces consist of multiple complex input curves. This can happen even on reloading the same part, causing the history tree to light up with red warnings as if it was a Christmas tree. In worst-case scenarios, error handling can take days for hefty assemblies.</p>
